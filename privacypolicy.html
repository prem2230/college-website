            of this Privacy Policy and if you do not accept the Privacy Policy enumerated herein below, please do not proceed further to use/access the site.
            <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
        </p>
        <p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a form. When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address,
            mailing address or phone number. You may, however, visit our site anonymously. The information about the user as collected by SRM Institute of Science and Technology falls. <br> Questions regarding this statement should be directed to SRM
            Institute of Science and Technology by contacting SRM TRP Engineering College, NH 45, Mannachanallur Taluk, Tiruchirappalli District, Irungalur, Tamil Nadu 621105 or by calling our main number at 0431-2258940/0431-2258681/0431-2258947
            <br> To make use of certain features on our websites, visitors must provide certain information as part of the registration process. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, sex, age, and PIN code, and we might request information
            on your occupation, interests, and the like). <br> The information you supply will help us to make our website better by allowing us to tailor our site to suit your interests and make it more useful to you. Supplying such information is entirely
            voluntary. In some instances, which involve, for example, subscriptions or contests, you may need to provide all the information before the subscription can reach you. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Do we use cookies?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember
            certain information. <br> We use cookies to help make our websites to be more responsive to the needs of our visitors. The cookies assign each visitor a unique, random number (a sort of user ID) that resides on their computer. The cookie merely
            identifies the computer that a visitor uses to access our sites. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only
            personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalized Newsletter/ Horoscope information). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign
            their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.</p>
        <h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. All information gathered on the SRM TRP Engineering College website is securely stored
            within the website controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system
            is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting
            to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Links To Third Party Sites / Ad-Servers</h3>
        <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content
            and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites. <br> We do not provide any personally identifiable information to third party websites / advertisers
            / ad-servers without your consent. <br> When we present information to our advertisers to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our websites, it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic
            to various pages within our sites. If you do register with our Website, we may, from time to time, contact you about content and features that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
        <h3>What do we use your information for?</h3>
        <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: <br> 1. To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs) <br> 2. To improve our website (we continually strive
            to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive) <br> 3. To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature <br> 4. To send periodic emails <br> 5. To measure traffic within our site and let
